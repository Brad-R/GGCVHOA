GGC Bundled Services Agreement

As a point of reference, GGC’s operational business plan for sustainable infrastructure and business services we plan to offer residents fall into three main categories:

1.	Water
2.	Agriculture, food and “waste” management
3.	Energy

Water Related Services

1.	Residents will be charged for their water use, based on the volume of water they use on a monthly basis. GGC will install a water meter on each line into each residential property. Water billing rates in other communities in Chile are typically 5 Pesos per liter of water use, roughly $.01 USD per liter, which is similar to many US municipal water rates. In the USA the average household water use per person per day is 70 gallons, 20%-30% of which is for conventional high water-volume toilets that GGC residents will not have. We expect that average residential water volume per person at GGC will be 50 gallons or 200 liters per person per day. GGC’s rates per liter of water use will initially be set at 2 Chilean Pesos per liter, less than half of the cost of comparable Chilean communities. Rates may change over time depending on potential changes to GGC’s cost of pumping/managing water, but any rate changes will have to be agreed to by residents by mutual (GGC and Resident) approval. 

2.	There will not be a human bio-solid waste disposal system, at least initially, although this may be developed in the future. If a sewer/solids treatment system is developed, GGC residents will have the option of using it, or continuing with their composting toilet or holding tank system. 

3.	GGC will offer free residential removal service of composting toilet materials because this material can be used as a valuable input GGC’s compost production and agricultural operations.

4.	GGC will be offering high quality non-toxic household products from the USA, Australia and other markets for sale.

5.	Grey-water: GGC will be offering a plumbing/installation/design service to residents to install simple and effective grey-water systems. This means water from sinks, showers, laundry, etc will be drained into the gardens, yard and landscape surrounding each home. This will minimize the volume of water going into septic holding tanks and thereby minimize the frequency/cost of tank pump-out while enabling residents to water residential gardens and yards with non-pathogenic waste water.

6.	Community water system: every lot will have access to a gravity-fed water system that will be active regardless of any potential power grid outages. GGC will use primarily solar powered pumps to keep high elevation cisterns, water towers and reservoirs full with water from underground aquifers at all times. Even if the grid power goes down, all irrigation and residential water supply will continue without interruption. 

Housing, Energy, and Communications Related Services

1.	GGC will be offering energy related services to residents and the regional markets including solar hot water and solar electric system installation/service and compost-powered hot water systems through our own staff and third party vendors. Residents are free to do business with other solar or residential energy system vendors.

2.	GGC and our partners will have a greenhouse and tree plantation to supply young trees and starter plants that are best suited to this region and climate. 

3.	Innovation and Business District: The GGC community center and Business District will include land that is available for lease for commercial enterprise. GGC’s innovation hub will be designed to facilitate business development by GGC’s current and future residents offering free and paid consulting to help incubate and encourage business. We’ll be inviting innovators and experts from around the world to use GGC as a research and development base while sharing their knowledge and offerings with GGC residents to incubate creative and productive enterprise.  

Agriculture and Waste Management Services

1.	As soil fertility is essential for organic agriculture, GGC will be offering several services to residents and the regional economy focused on modern effective compost management to ensure that 100% of food-waste and other biomass materials produced in the community are composted instead of hauled away to a landfill.

2.	Recycling and household garbage: GGC will facilitate or offer regular collection services for recyclables and non-compostable household garbage that will be on par with or lower than typical rates in the Curacavi region.

3.	A separate area of stables and pasture is available for residents use near the north border of GGC and Rio Puangue.
