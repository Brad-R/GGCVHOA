Galt’s Gulch Chile Voluntary Home Owners Association

Article I : General Guidelines

Galt’s Gulch Chile (GGC) is operated under the belief that voluntarism, innovation and responsibility are the best principles to guide our community. In order to realize these ideals we seek to establish market prices for services and opt in / opt out based mechanisms to enable people to interact in a voluntary and peaceful manor. This document is intended to illustrate an outline of intentions and goals in terms of home owners’ association guidelines. 

VHOA Framework:

1. Individuals will choose a voluntary home owners association.

2. Individuals have the ability to opt into the VHOA of their choice.

3. Individuals have the ability to opt out of the VHOA of their choice.

4. Individuals have the ability to create new VHOA's with different services, rules and responsibilities.

GGC is being built on a foundation of individual property rights. To ensure the prosperity of a property rights driven community, and an abundant future potential conflicts between individuals will be resolved by voluntary arbitration.

We plan to not have any HOA fees for residents since GGC can cover cost of basic services via other means. However, there will be reasonable below-market rates for utilities and services offered by GGC such as water, power and waste management. 

While we intend to minimize rules and instead facilitate solutions with guidelines and resources made available, there will need to be some recourse against those who violate our community rules. Our simple approach to conflict resolution in these matters is to send a written warning of any violations, giving the resident 30 days to comply or establish an acceptable compliance plan. If after 30 days there is still an unresolved issue in the opinion of GGC management, the resident and GGC and anyone who has a complaint against the resident will immediately enter binding mediation facilitated by experienced mediators who will determine the contractually binding remedy of the situation. 
As a point of reference, GGC’s operational business plan for sustainable infrastructure and business services we plan to offer residents fall into three main categories:

1.	Water
2.	Agriculture, food and “waste” management
3.	Energy

Rules/guidelines related to water:

1.	Maintaining clean surface and ground water and conserving water in general, is a top priority. GGC owns tremendous above/below-ground water rights, but keeping our water resource healthy is perhaps our most important priority for the future. 

2.	Residents will not be permitted to install traditional septic systems with leach fields that percolate human solid waste into the ground. Instead, residents will be encouraged to use the composting toilet installation/maintenance service that GGC will be offering, or residents can install low flow toilets and a simple holding tank system that would be pumped out on an annual or bi-annual basis. Modern composting toilets are more affordable than septic systems and have zero odors or maintenance issues. GGC will offer free residential removal service of composting toilet materials because this material can be used as a valuable input GGC’s compost production and agricultural operations.

3.	Grey-water: GGC will be offering a plumbing/installation/design service to residents to install simple and effective grey-water systems. This means water from sinks, showers, laundry, etc will be drained into the gardens, yard and landscape surrounding each home. This will minimize the volume of water going into septic holding tanks and thereby minimize the frequency/cost of tank pump-out while enabling residents to water residential gardens and yards with non-pathogenic waste water.

4.	Community water system: every lot will have access to a gravity-fed water system that will be active regardless of any potential power grid outages. GGC will use primarily solar powered pumps to keep high elevation cisterns, water towers and reservoirs full with water from underground aquifers at all times. Even if the grid power goes down, all irrigation and residential water supply will continue without interruption. 

5.	There will be no community sewer or central human bio-solid waste disposal system, at least initially, although this may be developed in the future. If a sewer/solids treatment system is developed, GGC residents will have the option of using it, or continuing with their composting toilet or holding tank system. 

6.	All household cleaning products used by residents must be non-toxic natural products, approved by GGC or sourced from the GGC store. This is to preserve the health of the land and water and will not add any significant incremental cost of living to residents. GGC is currently sourcing high quality non-toxic household products from the USA, Australia and other markets.

7.	Residents will be charged for their water use, based on the volume of water they use on a monthly basis. GGC will install a water meter on each line into each residential property. Water billing rates in other communities in Chile are typically 5 Pesos per liter of water use, roughly $.01 USD per liter, which is similar to many US municipal water rates. In the USA the average household water use per person per day is 70 gallons, 20%-30% of which is for conventional high water-volume toilets that GGC residents will not have. We expect that average residential water volume per person at GGC will be 50 gallons or 200 liters per person per day. GGC’s rates per liter of water use will initially be set at 2 Chilean Pesos per liter, less than half of the cost of comparable Chilean communities. Rates may change over time depending on potential changes to GGC’s cost of pumping/managing water, but any rate changes will be voted on by resident-members in order to be approved or amended. 

8.	Ponds and water features: Residents will be allowed and encouraged to install ponds, swales and other water retention features, especially those designed to retain rain water. However, ponds and water features cannot in any way block or infringe on any year round or seasonal stream/river flows, and residents will not be allowed to drill their own well without paying GGC’s established rates per liter of water used. All underground aquifer/water rights on all residential properties are held in ownership by GGC.

Rules/guidelines related to agriculture and waste management:

1.	GGC is committed to 100% organic agriculture and a complete ban on GMO seeds and chemical pesticides/herbicides. All seeds, plants and organisms raised in the community need to be certified organic or sourced from the GGC farm store directly. 

2.	GGC and our partners will have a greenhouse and tree plantation to supply young trees and starter plants that are best suited to this region and climate. 

3.	As soil fertility is essential for organic agriculture, GGC will be offering several services to residents and the regional economy focused on modern effective compost management to ensure that 100% of food-waste and other biomass materials produced in the community are composted instead of hauled away to a landfill. There will be no rule forcing everyone to compost their food scraps and yard waste. However, GGC will offer composting systems and free collection of compostable materials for all residents, which will augment our fertility investments on GGC farm operations. 

4.	Recycling and household garbage: GGC will facilitate or offer regular collection services for recyclables and non-compostable household garbage that will be on par with or lower than typical rates in the Curacavi region. No on-site garbage stock-piling, burning or burying will be allowed by any resident. Published schedules of pickup service will be available. Garbage and recycling cannot be left out on the street except on the day of scheduled pickup. 

5.	Grazing, compost production and animal husbandry will be encouraged and facilitated throughout GGC owned property and residential lots. However, these activities will need reasonable restrictions and limitations to prevent disturbance of neighboring properties. Agricultural activities often mean temporary side-effects such as odors and noises commonly associated with farming and other attributes of a working landscape. On-site compost production shall be limited to household food/yard waste and bio-solids from approved live-stock raised on site. Compost production must either be contained in an approved aerated/odor-filtered housing or produced no closer than 100 meters from any adjacent property. Livestock limitations per .5 hectare of residential property are as follows:
a.	Two cattle or dairy cows; 6 sheep/goats/llamas; 12 chickens; 1 rooster; 2 horses
b.	Any infraction of these limitations will result in a warning with 30 days to remedy, followed by forced sale of the number of animals held on the property in excess of limits, if mediation finds the resident negligent of the rules.

6.	A separate area of stables and pasture is available for residents use near the north border of GGC and Rio Puangue. 

Rules and guidelines regarding housing, energy, communications, motor vehicle-traffic:

1.	GGC will be offering energy related services to residents and the regional markets including solar hot water and solar electric system installation/service and compost-powered hot water systems through our own staff and our approved partners. Residents are free to do business with other solar or residential energy system vendors. 

2.	Wind turbines or communications towers above 10 meters in height above the roof line of a residential home will not be permitted on residential lots without approval of GGC and adjoining property owners. The wind resource at GGC is not a viable source of energy other than for small scale irrigation systems. 

3.	Wood-burning stoves/furnaces for home heating/hot-water: there will be no restrictions against this nor any rules regarding what type of wood-burning appliance is used. But it should be noted that the ecology of the area is not suited for large scale firewood-harvesting, nor is there much need for winter space heating. A primary goal of GGC over time will be to increase the mass, size and height of the forest canopy across the land to help retain moisture and enable more agricultural/ecological abundance. Tree coppicing for firewood production with fast-growing species such as Black Locust is an example of the kind of biomass energy GGC would highly encourage and facilitate. 

4.	Airplane and helicopter landing areas: helipads or landing strips will not be allowed on lots owned by residents, to avoid disturbing the community. However, a landing strip and heli-pad are available nearby in Curacavi. Use of radio controlled aircraft is allowed only directly above property owned by the user, or over non-residential areas and is restricted to between the hours of 10am and 6pm. 

5.	No motorized all-terrain off-road vehicles may be used in residential property, other than on rights of way and roads. ATV-friendly trails in the mountains and property in the Paungue region (3 kilometers from GGC) are available for use by off road motorized vehicles.  

6.	Housing styles:  no mobile homes, double-wides or homes otherwise understood to be “temporary housing” will be allowed on site for more than one year without approval of GGC and adjoining property owners. Homes may not be taller than two full stories, or 12 meters,  from the ground level to the roof-peak at any given vertical line, without approval from GGC and adjoining property owners, in order to avoid impeding scenic views for other residents. Creative home design/construction will be encouraged including alternative designs such as earth ships, domes, tiny houses and adapted cargo containers. The most appropriate building styles for this region will maximize thermal mass, shade from summer sun, and solar exposure during winter months. There will be no rules about home colors, materials or other building codes, and no building permits are required by Chilean government. 

7.	Noise ordinance: there will be no rules about quite hours or noise ordinances. If any resident has a problem with noise coming from another property, GGC will be happy to provide low cost mediation service to enable quick and reasonable settlement of any disputes between neighbors related to noise or any other issue. 

8.	Landscaping: there will be no rules requiring lawns to be mowed or otherwise dictating how residents maintain their property, unless there are any runoff or waste issues that are infringing upon someone else’s property in which case binding arbitration shall be the remedy.

9.	Innovation and Business District: The GGC community center and Business District will include land that is available for lease for commercial enterprise. GGC’s innovation hub will be designed to facilitate business development by GGC’s current and future residents offering free and paid consulting to help incubate and encourage business. We’ll be inviting innovators and experts from around the world to use GGC as a research and development base while sharing their knowledge and offerings with GGC residents to incubate creative and productive enterprise.  

10.	Business operation and “zoning”: any GGC resident is encouraged to operate a home based business, agricultural or otherwise, from their property, within the limitations described herein. Any conflicts between GGC and residents regarding business activities that are disturbing to other residents shall be resolved by binding mediation. Business licenses or permits will not be required by GGC, however there may be certain steps required by Chilean law in these regards depending on the type of business.
