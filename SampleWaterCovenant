Covenant Rules / Guidelines Related to Water
1.	Maintaining clean surface and ground water and conserving water in general, is a top priority. GGC owns tremendous above/below-ground water rights, but keeping our water resource healthy is perhaps our most important priority for the future. 

2.	Residents will not be permitted to install traditional septic systems with leach fields that percolate human solid waste into the ground. Instead, residents will be encouraged to use the composting toilet installation/maintenance service that GGC will be offering, or residents can install low flow toilets and a simple holding tank system that would be pumped out on an annual or bi-annual basis. Modern composting toilets are more affordable than septic systems and have zero odors or maintenance issues. 

3.	All household cleaning products used by residents must be non-toxic natural products, approved by GGC or sourced from the GGC store. This is to preserve the health of the land and water and will not add any significant incremental cost of living to residents. 

4.	Ponds and water features: Residents will be allowed and encouraged to install ponds, swales and other water retention features, especially those designed to retain rain water. However, ponds and water features cannot in any way block or infringe on any year round or seasonal stream/river flows, and residents will not be allowed to drill their own well without paying GGCâ€™s established rates per liter of water used. All underground aquifer/water rights on all residential properties are held in ownership by GGC.
